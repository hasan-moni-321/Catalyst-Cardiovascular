 ## Identifying Cardiovascular Disease Using Catalyst
 
 
 ## About Dataset
 It is a binary classification. The dataset is totally imbalance. Where cardio class have around 400 and non-cardio class have 2000 dataset. 
 
 
 ## Feture Engineering(Selection)
 1. Outlier detecting and removing  
 2. Checking imbalance  
 3. Fixing some columns where integer and string mix. Full expression of data  
 4. Increasing number of features  
 5. Finding correlation
 6. For feature selection, used multiple algorithms
  1. LinearSVC  
  2. Lasso  
  3. Chi-2  
  4. Logistic Regression  
  5. Random Forest  
  6. VarianceThreshold  
 
 
 ## For Catalyst
 1. Building Custom Dataset
 2. Custom Runner
 3. Building Multiple Model
